# knn-from-scratch
Created a Python program for K Nearest Neighbor Algorithm implementation from scratch. Determined the Euclidean distance between the data points to classify a new data point as per the maximum number of nearest neighbors. Implemented the algorithm on sklearnâ€™s IRIS dataset which achieved an accuracy of 95.56%.
